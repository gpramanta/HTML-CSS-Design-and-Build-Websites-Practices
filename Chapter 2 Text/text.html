        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.
        On her desk, lying between the copies of <cite>Nature, New Scientist</cite>,
        and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was 
        a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book 
        since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt 
        she needed to be free.</p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster 
        with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people 
        who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, 
        unraveling the secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, 
        to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
