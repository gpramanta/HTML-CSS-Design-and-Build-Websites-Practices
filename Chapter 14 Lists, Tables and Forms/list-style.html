        <h1>Quotes from Edgar Allan Poe</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I have great faith in fools; self-confidence my friends call it.</li>
            <li>All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.</li>
            <li>I would define, in belief, the poetry of words as the rhytmical creation of Beauty.</li>
